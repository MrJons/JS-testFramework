# TEST-ICKLE
## THE LITTLE JAVASCRIPT TEST FRAMEWORK

This is a small JS testing framework developed by wannabe junior devs at 'Makers Academy'

To use this testing framework:
  - Clone the repository
  - Add your tests to the `spec` folder
  - Add your Java Script files to the source folder
  - Add the files to the `specRunner.html` e.g. `<script src= "./spec/exampleTestSpec.js"></script>`
  - And then in your Terminal type `open specRunner.html`
  - Sit back and enjoy the beautiful process of developing TDD code
